# thrive_erp_install_script19


This script is based on the install script from André Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts) but goes a bit further and has been improved. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/ This script can be safely used in a multi-odoo code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.
Installing Nginx

If you set the parameter INSTALL_NGINX to True you should also configure workers. Without workers you will probably get connection loss issues. Look at the deployment guide from Odoo on how to configure workers.
